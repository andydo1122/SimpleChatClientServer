Touching upon sockets and also later adding multithreading
for multiple clients.

How to run:
Compile both server.cpp and client.cpp

For Server - run ./server [same port client]

For client - run ./client 127.0.0.1 [port]


*****NOTE*****
127.0.0.1 is the standard IPv4 address when setting up a local network.
Any other made up IP address does not work.
